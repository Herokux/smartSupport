				<p>Arbitration Agreement</p>
				<p>(a) Writer and White Panda agree and acknowledge that they will utilize final and binding arbitration to resolve all disputes that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement, the Services and Writer's relationship with White Panda, including retroactively requiring the use of arbitration for any dispute that may have arisen from the time that Writer began providing services to White Panda. Both White Panda and Writer agree that any claim, dispute, and/or controversy that either Writer may have against White Panda (or its owners, directors, officers, managers, employees, agents, and parties affiliated with its employee benefit and health plans) or White Panda may have against Writer, arising from, related to, or having any relationship or connection whatsoever with Writer's contract relationship with White Panda, including the classification of Writer as an independent contractor shall be submitted to and determined exclusively by binding arbitration. Writer acknowledges that this Agreement evidences a transaction in commerce. Included within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement are all disputes, whether based on tort, contract, statute, equitable law, or otherwise (excluding workers compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance claims). Claims may be brought before an administrative agency but only to the extent applicable law permits access to such an agency notwithstanding the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration.</p>
				<p> (b) In arbitration, the parties will have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any disputes in this regard shall be resolved by the Arbitrator. However, there will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class, collective or representative action ("Class Action Waiver"). Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement, the preceding sentence shall not be severable from this Agreement in any case in which the dispute to be arbitrated is brought as a class, collective or representative action. Although Writer will not be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of exercising Writer's rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act by the filing of or participation in a class, collective or representative action in any forum, White Panda may lawfully seek enforcement of this Agreement and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class, collective or representative actions or claims. Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement, any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.</p>
				<p>(c) Resolution of the dispute shall be based solely upon the law governing the claims and defenses pleaded, and the arbitrator may not invoke any basis other than such controlling law. The arbitrator shall have the immunity of a judicial officer from civil liability when acting in the capacity of an arbitrator, which immunity supplements any other existing immunity. Awards shall include the arbitrator's written reasoned opinion. Writer and White Panda understand and agree to this binding arbitration provision, and both Writer and White Panda give up our right to trial by jury of any claim Writer and White Panda may have against each other.</p>
				<p>(d) The parties shall each bear their respective costs for legal representation at any such arbitration, except to the extent attorney's fees are explicitly provided by law. The parties shall split any initial administrative fee charged by the Arbitrator, up to a maximum cost to Writer of two hundred fifty dollars (US$250.00). The cost of the arbitrator and court reporter, if any, shall initially be borne by White Panda; however, the Arbitrator shall have the discretion to award appropriate costs to the prevailing party, as provided by law, and/or to require the parties to split the costs associated with the arbitrator and/or court reporter.</p>
				<p>(e) Except as stated in Paragraph M(c), if any term or provision, or portion of this Arbitration Agreement is declared void or unenforceable it shall be severed and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable.</p>
				<br>
				<p>WRITER'S SIGNATURE, ELECTRONIC OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING THE ACCEPTANCE OF A JOB AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, ATTESTS TO THE FACT THAT WRITER HAS READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREED TO BE LEGALLY BOUND TO ALL OF THE ABOVE TERMS OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>

				<p>Severability: If any provision of the Writer Contract is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Writer Contract will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
				<p>No Assignment: The Writer Contract, and the party's rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned or otherwise transferred by either party without the other's prior written consent, and any attempted violation of the foregoing will be null and void.

				<p>Notices: Each party must deliver all notices or other communications required or permitted under the Writer Contract to the other party at the contact information identified in these terms or elsewhere on the Site.</p>
				<p>Injunctive Relief: Writer acknowledges that, because its services are personal and unique and because Writer will have access to Confidential Information of White Panda, any breach of the Writer Contract by Writer would cause irreparable injury to White Panda for which monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy and, therefore, will entitle White Panda to injunctive relief (including specific performance). The rights and remedies provided to each party in the Writer Contract are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies available to such party at law or in equity.</p>
				<p>Waiver: Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Writer Contract on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p>

				<p>Entire Agreement: The Writer Contract is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matters hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matters.
